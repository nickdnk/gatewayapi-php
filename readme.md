# GatewayAPI PHP Library

This library will allow you to integrate the **GatewayAPI.com** API in your project using modern PHP7 and an OOP structure.
For full description of their API, error codes and so on, see: <https://gatewayapi.com/docs>.

### Prerequisites

You need an active account at <https://www.gatewayapi.com> to use this library.
Once you have that you need to generate an API key/secret pair under **API** -> **API Keys**.


### Installation

To include this in your project, install it using Composer.

As we use return types and type hints, this library requires PHP 7.1.

`composer require nickdnk/gatewayapi-php`

### How to use

```php
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\CancelResult;
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\DeliveryStatusWebhook;
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\GatewayAPIHandler;
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\IncomingMessageWebhook;
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\Recipient;
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\SMSMessage;
use nickdnk\GatewayAPI\Webhook;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

$handler = new GatewayAPIHandler('my_key', 'my_secret');

$message1 = new SMSMessage(
    
    // The message you want to send. Include any placeholder tag strings.
    'Hello, %FIRSTNAME%! Your code is: %CODE%.',
    
    // The name of the sender as seen by the recipient.
    // 1-11 ASCII characters, spaces are removed. 
    'MyService',

    // An array containing the recipient(s) you want to send the message
    // to. You can also pass an empty array and add recipients later on.
    // See the example below the constructor.
    [new Recipient(4512345678, ['John', '23523'])],

    // Arbitrary label added to your message(s).
    // Pass null if you don't need this.
    'customer1',

    // The strings to replace in your message with tag values for each
    // recipient. Pass an empty array if you don't use tags in your message.
    ['%FIRSTNAME%', '%CODE%'],
    
    // The UNIX timestamp for when you want your message to be sent.
    // Pass null to send immediately. This should *not* be less than
    // the current UNIX time. This example sends in 1 hour.
    time() + 3600,
    
    // The message class to use. Note that prices vary. The secret class
    // requires approval by GatewayAPI on your account before you can use
    // it, otherwise you will get an error.
    SMSMessage::CLASS_STANDARD

);

// If you prefer a shorter constructor, you can use the default values
// and set your parameters after construction.
$message2 = new SMSMessage('Hello %NAME%! Your code is: %CODE%', 'MyService');

$message2->setSendTime(time() + 3600);
$message2->setClass(SMSMessage::CLASS_PREMIUM);
$message2->setUserReference('customer1');
$message2->setTags(['%NAME%', '%CODE%']);

$message2->addRecipient(new Recipient(4587652222, ['Martha', '42442']));

try {

    // Note that a single SMSMessage must not contain more than 10,000
    // recipients. If you want to send to more than 10,000 you should split
    // your recipients into several SMSMessages. You can, however, send
    // multiple SMSMessages in a single request.
    $result = $handler->deliverMessages(
        [
            $message1,
            $message2
        ]
    );
    
    // All message IDs returned.
    $messageIds = $result->getMessageIds();

    // The total cost of this request (all message IDs combined).
    $totalCost = $result->getTotalCost();

    // Currency you were charged in.
    $currency = $result->getCurrency();

    // The number of messages sent. For a message that's 3 SMSes long
    // with 1000 recipients, this will be 3000.
    $totalMessagesSent = $result->getTotalSMSCount();

    // Messages sent to UK only.
    $ukMessages = isset($result->getCountries()['UK'])
    ? $result->getCountries()['UK']
    : 0;

### Tests

If you want to run the unit tests that don't require credentials, simply
run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests` from the root of the project.

If you want to test the parts that interact with the API you must
provide credentials in `GatewayAPIHandlerTest.php`, uncomment the line
that skips the test and run the above command. Note that this sends out
live SMS and will cost you 1 SMS in credits per execution.
