     * that this happens if the response is valid JSON but is missing required properties.
     *
     * If you have a system in place that automatically retries failed requests you should definitely catch this error
     * and stop retrying, as you could risk going into an infinite loop that keeps sending out messages until you run
     * out of credit or something similarly terrible happens.
